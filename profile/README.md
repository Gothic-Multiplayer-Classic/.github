## 🕯️ What is GMPC?

**Gothic Multiplayer Classic (GMPC)** is a community-driven revival of Gothic Multiplayer, focused on *freedom for server creators* and a cleaner, more modern foundation. The project began as an effort to make the old multiplayer playable again - then evolved into something more ambitious: a reworked codebase where servers are defined by scripts instead of hardcoded gameplay rules.

🔓 GMPC is developed and maintained by the **GMPC Team** and is fully **open-source**.

## 🧭 Short history

Gothic Multiplayer has always been about doing something the base game never promised: sharing a world with other fans. The earliest versions were simple and limited, but they created unforgettable moments - role-play hubs, spontaneous duels, and chaotic runs across familiar landscapes with dozens of players. Even when synchronization wasn’t perfect and the "game" part was minimal, the *community* definitely wasn’t.

Over the years, different branches and ideas came and went: experiments with richer tooling, scripting, launchers, and asset delivery. Some projects never reached a proper public release; others pushed the concept forward by focusing on scripting as the core of server creation. That shift - from "fixed game modes" to "build your own server logic" - is what ultimately shaped the direction that GMPC follows today.

📌 In **2022**, the original code was published publicly, reopening the door for patching, updates, and long-term maintenance. Since then, GMPC has been steadily refactored with one clear goal: keep what made classic Gothic Multiplayer special, while removing the constraints that prevented creators from doing more.

<details>
  <summary><b>Why "Classic"?</b></summary>
  <br>
  "Classic" is about the spirit - the familiar worlds, the social chaos, the RP and PvP stories people still remember. The goal isn’t to freeze the project in time, but to preserve what made it fun, while upgrading the foundation so creators can go further than the old limits ever allowed.

## 🛠️ Today’s direction

GMPC intentionally drops old, rigid gameplay systems (such as predefined classes and hardcoded modes) to make room for **Lua scripting**, split into **server-side** and **client-side** layers. The idea is straightforward: instead of forcing every server into the same structure, GMPC provides a stable multiplayer core and lets creators build the actual experience on top - whether that’s RP, PvP, co-op, custom progression, minigames, or something entirely new.

At the same time, parts of the old stack have been reintroduced in a more modern form - including systems like localization, logging, and configuration - so running and maintaining a server is less painful than it used to be.
